# Heat VR
Tools and patches for the Heat game

## Guide:
This repository is mainly composed of two directories: [tools]() and [the legacy stuff]()

### Tools
[![Release Builder](https://github.com/mgbhbjcvkn/HeatGame/releases/tag/v2.0)](https://github.com/mgbhbjcvkn/HeatGame/releases/tag/v2.0)

The existing tools are available [Here](/Tools/). We currently have:
- [**HeatDownloader**](/Tools/HeatDownloader/): A tool (scrapper) that allows you to download the latest version of the game
- [**AuthPatcher**](/Tools/AuthPatcher/): A tool that patches the paywall system in the game

### Legacy
Old patches that are not suported anymore
